This tool reads pngs in color format RGBA only. It applies thresholding on the alpha channel and saves the shape of the depicted object as a list of points. Then it greedily removes the points which impact the shape least until there would be too much removed or the specified number of points is reached.

Settings are currently done in the polymaker.cpp file (search for "TWEAK" in comments). The only parameter the program takes is the path to a png file and the output is written to stdout.

Building:
You need the libpng library and development headers (on Ubuntu this is the package libpng12-dev), a c++ compiler and make.
To build, just type
	make

Usage:
If you have tweaked the code so that it produces pbm images with the vertexes, you could want to call the program somehow like this:
	./polymaker image.png > vertexes.pbm

You can open pbm pictures with different graphic programs. I use GIMP.
